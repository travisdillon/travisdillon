								<p>
									In my experience, good teaching is a blend of mathematics knowledge, understanding of student learning, performance, and empathy; and it requires both thoughtful preparation and comfort with improvisation. For me, the emotional payoff from a successful class, from seeing new understanding flash across a student's face, or from crafting and telling a carefully plotted mathematical story, is huge&mdash;I can ride that high for days. Which is why teaching, in a variety of forms, is one of the most challenging and rewarding activities I do as a graduate student.
								</p>
								<p>
									This page summarizes my teaching history, across summer math camps, middle school enrichment programs, mentoring, and fun mathematics lectures. I've taught in several settings and enjoyed them all, and I'm always on the lookout for more! If you're looking for someone to give a fun, engaging math talk or help with an outreach program or generally spread math enthusiasm, let me know! Chances are, I'd love to be a part of it.
								</p>


								<h2>Classroom teaching</h2>
									<p>I've been a TA for multivariable calculus and discrete geometry classes at MIT. I also taught for three summers at <a href="https://mathcamp.org">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, a five-week summer program for high school students who love math. One of the joys of teaching there is the freedom instructors have to design their own classes, both in subject and in style. Here are the classes I've designed and taught there:</p>

									<h3>2024</h3>

								<h2>Mentoring &amp; outreach</h2>
									<h3>Programs I've worked with</h3>

										<p>I worked at <a href="https://mathcamp.org">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a> in 2018 as an undergraduate, and in 2022, 2023, and 2024 as an instructor. I was also a semi-organizer and a tutor at <a href="https://mathsbeyondlimits.eu/">Maths Beyond Limits</a>, a fantastic two-week residential mathematics program in Poland, in 2023 and 2025. In 2023 and 2024, I was a mentor with <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/">MIT PRIMES</a>, a mathematics research program for high-school students.</p>

										<p>When I was an undergraduate, I helped facilitate a mathematics enrichment program at a middle school in Kimberly, Wisconsin. And when I studied abroad in Budapest, I was a volunteer enrichment instructor at the Budapest Derkovits School, where I designed math enrichment activities for primarily Hungarian-speaking students.</p>

										<p>For my undergraduate thesis, I wrote a book whose goal is to bring the experience of thinking mathematically to a broad audience. (You can read the introduction and the first chapter <a href="https://travisadillon.com/documents/ggi-excerpt.pdf">here</a>).</p>


									<h3>Fun math talks</h3>
										<p>
											I like stories (both <a href="reading">reading</a> and <a href="writing">writing</a> them), and the math I like best is told as a story: travelling from one place to another by an unexpected path, with twists and turns that weave old concepts into new understanding, finally reaching a surprising and satisfying ending.
										</p>
										<p>
											I believe that storytelling is an effective way to connect with people and spread awe, wonder, and excitement, and mathematics is no exception to this. Stories aren't just for kids, either: A good mathematical story can inspire an undergraduate student and infuse them with enthusiasm, or lift a graduate student out of a research funk and remind them of what they love.
										</p>

										<p>
											This principle guides all of my teaching, but it's especially notable in my broad-audience math talks, colloquia, and seminars, where my goal is to inspire, excite, and simply have a good time. Here are some of the topics I've shared with high school students, undergrads, and Ph.D. students:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>The Ra(n)do(m) graph:</strong> A story told through probability, graph theory, logic, and a classic Arlo Guthrie song.</li>
											<li><strong>Hat games &amp; unmeasurable sets:</strong> The construction of a nonmeasurable set via logic puzzles.</li>
											<li><strong>(Almost) equiangular vectors:</strong> Ties together geometry, linear algebra, and probability to give an introduction to the strangeness of many-dimensional space.</li>
											<li><strong>4 dimensions is weird:</strong> An introduction to some strange things that can happen in 4 dimensions, and how to think about them in a structured way.</li>
											<li><strong>The quest for atonal spheres:</strong> A journey from 20th-century experimental music to abstract mathematics, with elements of group theory, combinatorics, probability, and measure theory.</li>
											<li><strong>Compactness in combinatorics:</strong> Uses surprising applications of topology in combinatorics to shed light on the definition of compactness, which is one of the most mysterious concepts students come across in their first topology course.</li>
											<li><strong>Calculus wars:</strong> A story about the origins of calculus, filled with ambition, jealousy, secrecy, political maneuvering, and the dawn of the Enlightenment era. It's a story about two titans of science, their lives and their legendary clash, and what it was like to be a scientist in the 1600s.</li>
											<li><strong>Fermat is false in finite fields:</strong> Combines graph theory, number theory, and group theory to prove that Fermat's Last Theorem is not just untrue in finite fields, but extremely, outlandishly false.</li>
											<li><strong>Fire and chaos:</strong> A talk about understanding fractals, and how to use that to draw really pretty pictures.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>If these sound intriguing and you're interested in having me present a mathematical story at your institution, let me know! I'm always glad to share joy in math.</p>

												<li>"I really enjoyed all the proofs because he explained everything thoroughly and would rephrase the central idea several times to make it more clear and understandable."</li>

												<li>"I love Travis’s classes!"</li>
												<li>"I really enjoy Travis' engaging and personal method of teaching!"</li>
												<li>"He explains things very clearly, and is very funny"</li>

												<li>When asked "What was your best academic experience at Mathcamp?", nine students responded with one of my classes. One student wrote:
													<blockquote>Ra(n)do(m) graph class, only 50 minutes, but a lot of "plot twists", proofs and different types of maths interacting, best class!!!</blockquote>

										</div>
										<div class="button-dropdown-content" id="students-MC-22-content">

												<li>"I loved his forbidden words class!! It was so chill and the homework was the right amount of thought provoking to do a lot of it. I would've loved to have taken more of his classes." [Homework at Mathcamp is optional, and students decide what to work on based on their own interest.]</li>
												<li>"He really paid attention to where the students were in the class and rather than teaching the topic, I felt like he was teaching to me."</li>
												<li>"He's extremely approachable (for a few days, I thought he was a camper), and always fun to talk with"</li>
												<li>"He's very good at making sure everybody understands what he's teaching."</li>
												<li>"He paces well and gives good explanations."</li>
												<li>"Travis explains the concepts well and make them easy to understand."</li>
